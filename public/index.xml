      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the unified protocol for treating co-morbid health anxiety and depression: An empirical case study</title>
      <link>/blog/up-sced/</link>

      <description>Abstract     Aims: The Unified Protocol (UP) is indicated when patients present with comorbidity, but no studies have investigated the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression.
Method: An A/B single case design evaluated outcomes for a 27-year-old male presenting with health anxiety and comorbid depression. Following a 21-day assessment- baseline period, the manualised UP was delivered across a 42-day period containing seven intervention sessions.</description>

      <title>Treatment of compulsive buying disorder: Comparing the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy with person-centred experiential.</title>

      <description>Abstract     Background: Outcome studies of the treatment of compulsive buying disorder (CBD) have rarely compared the effectiveness of differing active treatments.
Aims: This study sought to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and person-centred experiential therapy (PCE) in a cross-over design.
Method: This was an ABC single case experimental design with extended follow-up with a female patient meeting diagnostic criteria for CBD. Ideographic CBD outcomes were intensively measured over a continuous 350-day time series.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Cognitive Analytic Therapy for Mixed Anxiety and Depression in the Context of Borderline Traits: A Quasi-Experimental Single Case Design Evaluation</title>

      <description>Abstract     The evidence base for the use of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) as a short-term, integrative and relational psychotherapy for anxiety and depression is building. This study contributes by intensively studying change in two types of quantitative outcomes (ideographic and nomothetic) over treatment time. The study employed an A/B quasi experimental single case design method with a 25-year old male patient with a diagnosis of mixed anxiety and depression in the context of borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of transdiagnostic seminars to support patients with common mental disorders: A multi-service practice research network study</title>
      <link>/blog/up-sced/</link>

      <guid>/blog/up-sced/</guid>
      <description>Abstract     Background: This was a multi-site evaluation of psycho-educational transdiagnostic seminars (TDS) as a pre-treatment intervention to enhance the effectiveness and utilisation of high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of TDS combined with high-intensity CBT (TDS+CBT) versus a matched sample receiving CBT only. Second, to determine the consistency of results across participating services which employed CBT+TDS. Finally, to determine the acceptability of TDS across patients with different psychological disorders.</description>

      <title>The effectiveness of cognitive analytic therapy for borderline personality disorder: Utilizing a withdrawal experimental design to improve sensitivity to abandonment.</title>
      <link>/blog/sced-cat-bpd/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/sced-cat-bpd/</guid>
      <description>Abstract     Objectives: A primary methodological weakness of the single-case experimental design (SCED) outcome studies conducted of the treatment of personality disorder with cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) is that they have failed to employ a withdrawal phase or cross-over design and so are deemed quasi-experimental. This study sought to implement a withdrawal design, in order to improve the internal validity of the study to make it a true SCED, and also in order to enable the patient to explore abandonment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring how to deliver videoconference-mediated psychological therapy to adults with an intellectual disability during the coronavirus pandemic.</title>

      <description>Abstract     Purpose: The novel coronavirus and associated restrictions have resulted in mental health services across the UK having to adapt how they deliver psychological assessments and interventions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the accessibility and prospective acceptability of providing telephone and videoconference-mediated psychological interventions in individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Aims: As part of a service evaluation, a mixed-methods questionnaire was developed and completed by clients who had been referred for psychological therapy at an adult intellectual disabilities’ community health service in the north of England.</description>

      <title>The effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered in routine practice. Systematic review and meta-analysis</title>

      <description>Abstract     Purpose: This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of routinely delivered psychological therapies across inpatient, outpatient and University-based clinics.
Methods: This was a pre-registered systematic-review of studies meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria (CRD42020175235). Eligible studies were searched in three databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo. Pre-post treatment (uncontrolled) effect sizes were calculated and pooled using random effects meta-analysis to generate effectiveness benchmarks. Moderator analyses were used to examine sources of heterogeneity in effect sizes.</description>
