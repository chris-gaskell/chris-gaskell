      <description>Abstract     Aims: The Unified Protocol (UP) is indicated when patients present with comorbidity, but no studies have investigated the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression.
Method: An A/B single case design evaluated outcomes for a 27-year-old male presenting with health anxiety and comorbid depression. Following a 21-day assessment- baseline period, the manualised UP was delivered across a 42-day period containing seven intervention sessions.</description>
