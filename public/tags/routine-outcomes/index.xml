      <description>Abstract     Purpose: This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of routinely delivered psychological therapies across inpatient, outpatient and University-based clinics.
Methods: This was a pre-registered systematic-review of studies meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria (CRD42020175235). Eligible studies were searched in three databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo. Pre-post treatment (uncontrolled) effect sizes were calculated and pooled using random effects meta-analysis to generate effectiveness benchmarks. Moderator analyses were used to examine sources of heterogeneity in effect sizes.</description>
