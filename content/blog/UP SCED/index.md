abstract: Aims - The Unified Protocol (UP) is indicated when patients present with comorbidity, but no studies have investigated the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression. Method- An A/B single case design evaluated outcomes for a 27-year-old male presenting with health anxiety and comorbid depression. Following a 21-day assessment- baseline period, the manualised UP was delivered across a 42-day period containing seven intervention sessions. Four idiographic measures (occurrence and duration of health checking, sleep duration and food intake satisfaction) were collected daily throughout and two nomothetic measures were collected at four time-points. Results- All sessions were attended. Number of health checking episodes reduced from four per day to two per day. A 59 minute per day reduction in time spent health checking occurred and sleep increased by 100-minutes per night. There was little apparent change in terms of food intake satisfaction. There was a reliable and clinically significant reduction in depression. Discussion - Further testing of the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression in a true single case experimental design is now indicated.
