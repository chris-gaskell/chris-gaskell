## **Abstract**

**Purpose**: This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of routinely delivered psychological therapies across inpatient, outpatient and University-based clinics.

**Methods**: This was a pre-registered systematic-review of studies meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria (CRD42020175235). Eligible studies were searched in three databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo. Pre-post treatment (uncontrolled) effect sizes were calculated and pooled using random effects meta-analysis to generate effectiveness benchmarks. Moderator analyses were used to examine sources of heterogeneity in effect sizes.

**Results**: Overall, 252 studies (k = 298 samples) were identified, of which 223 (k = 263 samples) provided sufficient data for inclusion in meta-analysis. Results showed large pre- post treatment effects for depression (d = 0.96, [CI 0.88-1.04], p = < 0.001, k = 122), anxiety (d = 0.8 [CI 0.71-0.9], p = < 0.001, k = 69), and other outcomes (d = 1.01 [CI 0.93-1.09], p = < 0.001, k = 158).

**Conclusions**: This review provides support for the effectiveness of routinely delivered psychological therapy. Effectiveness benchmarks are supplied to support service evaluations across multiple settings.
