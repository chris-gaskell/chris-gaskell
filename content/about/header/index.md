## I'm a clinical psychologist in Manchester, UK :uk:

I'm highly passionate about all things clinical psychology, particularly the area of clinical neuropsychology.

**Lately...**
I have been working in brain injury and functional neurological disorders :brain:

In my spare time I like to contribute to clinically orientated research :man_technologist::man_health_worker:


I am an honorary researcher for the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk) :school:

I am a big advocate of teaching, sharing resources and innovation :rocket:

For the last couple of years I have been looking for ways to merge my interests of clinical psychology, data science & innovation.
