## I'm a clinical psychologist in Manchester, UK :uk:

I'm highly passionate about all things clinical psychology, particularly the area of clinical neuropsychology.

**Lately...**
I have been working in brain injury and functional neurological illnesses across the lifespan.

In my spare time I like to contribute to clinically orientated research. I am an honorary researcher for the University of Sheffield. I am a big advocate of teaching, sharing resources and innovation.

For the last couple of years I have been looking for ways to merge my interests of clinical psychology and data science/innovation.

Here is a link to my [cv](resume.pdf) and [visual cv](visual-resume.pdf)
