<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a clinical psychologist in the UK :uk: 

I am highly passionate about all things clinical psychology particularly the area of clinical neuropsychology. **Lately** I have been working in brain injury and functional neurological illnesses across the lifespan.

In my spare time I like to contribute to correctly orientated research; to which I am an honorary researcher for the University of Sheffield. I am a big advocate of high-quality teaching and sharing of resources.

For the last couple of years I have been looking for ways to merge my interests of clinical psychology and data science/innovation.
